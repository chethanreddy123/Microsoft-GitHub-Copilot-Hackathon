This project is part of the GitHub Copilot Hackathon. The goal of this hackathon is to utilize the capabilities of GitHub Copilot, an AI-powered coding assistant, to enhance the coding experience and productivity.

## Usage of Copilot in the Hackathon

During the development of this code, GitHub Copilot played a crucial role in assisting with various aspects of the coding process. Here are the key areas where Copilot was utilized:

1. Assisting non-native English speakers: GitHub Copilot was used to write code comments and descriptions in the native language "Telugu." This feature helps non-native English speakers to understand the code and its functionality more effectively.

2. Creating dictionaries with lookup data in Python: Copilot provided recommendations and suggestions for creating dictionaries, especially for lookup data in Python. This feature helped in optimizing the code and making it more efficient.

3. Testing the code: Copilot offered suggestions for writing test cases and provided code snippets for unit testing. This facilitated the testing process and ensured the code's reliability.

4. Auto suggestion and Auto Correcting for every single line: Copilot continuously provided auto-suggestions for completing code statements and corrected code errors and typos, ensuring the code's accuracy and reducing manual effort.

5. Recommending the Right comments based on the tone of writing code: Copilot analyzed the code context and provided appropriate comments and explanations based on the tone of the code. This helped in improving code readability and documentation.

6. Giving Multiple Suggestions: Copilot provided multiple suggestions for code implementation, enabling exploration of different approaches and solutions. This versatility allowed for a more comprehensive understanding of the problem and encouraged creative problem-solving.

## Problem Statement

The task was to create a command-line tool that accepts a city name as input and returns the current weather forecast for that city. OpenWeatherMap API was utilized to fetch weather data, and Python was used to parse the retrieved data. The solution aimed to showcase how GitHub Copilot can assist with API usage, data parsing, and error handling.

## Solution

The provided Python code utilizes OpenWeatherMap API to fetch weather data for a specified city. It includes a function, `weather_detail`, that retrieves the current weather details, including temperature, sky conditions, wind speed, sunrise and sunset times, and expected temperature alerts. The function also calculates and displays the maximum and minimum temperatures for each date in the forecast.

The code uses the `owm` module for weather data and handles exceptions, such as the `NotFoundError` when an invalid city name is entered. It makes use of the `datetime` module for date and time operations.

To run the code, follow these steps:

1. Install the necessary dependencies by running `pip install -r requirements.txt` in your command-line interface.
2. Replace the placeholder API key in the code with a valid OpenWeatherMap API key.
3. Execute the code in a Python environment.
4. Enter the desired city name when prompted.
5. Choose the temperature unit (Celsius or Fahrenheit) when prompted.

The code will then fetch and display the current weather forecast for the specified city, including temperature, sky conditions, wind speed, sunrise and sunset times, and expected temperature alerts. It will also provide the maximum and minimum temperatures for each date in the forecast.

Please note that a valid OpenWeatherMap API key is required to retrieve weather data. Make sure to replace the placeholder API key with your own key before running the code.

Feel free to explore and modify the code to suit your needs and preferences.

**Disclaimer: The accuracy of weather data depends on the OpenWeatherMap API and its availability.**

## Conclusion

The GitHub Copilot Hackathon provided an opportunity to experience the capabilities of GitHub Copilot and witness its impact on the coding process. With
